# Welcome to My Blog!

This blog aims to cover two main topics;

The first focues on optimization theories, probabilistic modeling, and various relevant computational methods that I am currently studying as part of my MS program in Operations Research at Georgia Tech.

The other centers on finance, particularly insights and experiences related to the South Korean financial market.

I hope visitors to his blog will find the content helpful and informative.
